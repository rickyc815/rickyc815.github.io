              Take some time to be good to yourself and improve your well-being!
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              During the winter months, we have to do a little more to take care
              of our general well-being. There’s are fewer daylight hours and
              it’s cold – such things can really drain one’s energy. Of course
              we can also make use of this peaceful time of year for positive
              things, because we can feel good about simply relaxing at home and
              putting our feet up. We’d like to help you out a little with
              taking it easy, so we’ve come up with another challenge for you:
              this time it’s the Well-Being Challenge. You get a new task
              everyday that will both increase your well-being and help you to
              relax. Why is this important? Spring is not far off, and that’s
              the time for getting back up to full speed again! Here are a few
              additional tips so that you can make the most of the final days of
              winter and improve your general well-being. Drink tea We’ve all
              heard the expression “not your cup of tea”, which is used to refer
              to something that you don’t like doing or that’s difficult for
              you. Why? Because it’s just so simple and pleasant to sit down for
              a cup of tea. Skip that hectic cup of coffee in the morning and
              have a cup of herbal tea instead. It’s also a good way to bring
              some peace to a stressful day Enjoy a massage Take the time to
              gently massage your face – it can really work wonders – or give
              your self a foot massage. This is easy enough to do anywhere. Not
              sure how to do the massage? Just make circles on the soles of your
              feet using your thumbs…start at your heels and work up to your
              toes. Do it again if you like, but this time try a little more
              pressure. Take a walk Fresh air is good for you, even if it’s cold
              and snowy outside. Go out and get some physical activity. It can
              be tempting to just roll up into a ball and wait for the cold to
              be over – keep in mind that doing something with your body in
              natural surroundings can also be great for your mood! Eat slowly
              Slowing down to eat rather than hurrying through your meal can be
              a really amazing experience. All too often we grab a bite on the
              run, and part of that is chewing too little and swallowing your
              food too fast. It’s a lot better for you to sit down for a meal
              and really pay attention to your food. Try to do that as often as
              you can…eventually you’ll develop a new positive habit. Learn to
              value your strengths Write down a list of things about yourself
              that you like. It’s easy enough to forget what we’re good at and
              what we’re truly all about. You can do this from time to time as
              it can be a big boost for your self confidence. Be your best self!
              Sit straight Oftentimes we don’t even notice when we’re not
              sitting up straight, for example slouching or leaning to one side.
              Though we might not think about it, good posture is part of being
              healthy. If you notice that you’re hunching forward when eating or
              working at your desk, try to remind yourself to pull your
              shoulders back and straighten your spine. It sound’s easy enough –
              just sit up straight – but it can be quite a challenge, don’t you
              think? Go offline Simply being unreachable for a while can be a
              real luxury in the world we live in today. Make time for this,
              maybe two hours or so, and deeply enjoy all the positives of being
              offline. Put your feet up So you’re offline…but now what? Use this
              time off to relax and just put your feet up. You can put a pillow
              or sofa cushion under your feet and ankles to make sitting like
              this even more comfortable. Try to find a way to get your feet to
              the same level as your heart. This improves circulation in your
              legs, and it also helps your legs to relax more. Wouldn’t this be
              a wonderful thing to do after a stressful day? Do you have any
              more tips to share? What are some other ways to improve your
              well-being? We’re already looking forward to the next
              challenge!&nbsp;&nbsp;
