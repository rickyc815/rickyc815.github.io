            <h1>A Chat with Karate World Champion Alisa Buchinger</h1>
            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              Austrian Alisa Buchinger is the karate world champion, and she
              also holds multiple under 21 titles. We interviewed this
              impressive Salzburg native – who is currently listed second in the
              WKF worldwide ranking – about her career and the success that
              she’s experienced as well as her motivation. What led you to start
              doing karate? How did you discover that you had a passion for it?
              I was 5 years old when I started training…I enjoyed the sport from
              the very beginning and so I stuck with it. The thing I like most
              about karate is that one has to master a variety of things. It’s
              not just about endurance – technique, speed, power and tactics all
              have an equally important role. Actually you have to train
              everything and be good in all aspects of the sport in order to be
              successful. That’s good I think, that one doesn’t just train one
              thing. Still, at the end of my career, I should be able to say
              that I accomplished what I set out to do. What motivates you? I
              always have a goal, like for example becoming a world champion,
              which is something I also achieved. Now I have the goal to take
              part in the 2020 Olympics. Having a goal in mind that I would like
              to reach is what motivates me. How important are goals for you?
              Goals are very important for me: whenever I set a goal for myself,
              I also want to reach it. If you’re as ambitious as I am, then
              reaching that goal is sure to happen sooner or later! Of course
              it’s possible that one fails and loses…that’s all part of it.
              Still, at the end of my career, I should be able to say that I
              accomplished what I set out to do. How do you deal with success on
              the one hand, and setbacks on the other? Both have advantages and
              disadvantages. Moments of success are naturally amazing, a time to
              be happy and just feel good. Nonetheless it’s not going to be any
              easier in the future because the competition never rests. As the
              favorite, you are the one people are going after. You’re the one
              to beat. The difficulty is that one has to learn to handle that
              pressure. On the other hand, it took me some time to learn to
              handle setbacks. I’m bad at losing, and so I first had to learn to
              deal with results that were not so good. It’s really important to
              learn that.
