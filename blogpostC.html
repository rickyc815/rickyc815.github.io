            <h1>8 Tips for Your Perfect Spring Cleaning</h1>
            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              Springtime is finally here, also marking its arrival with warmer
              temperatures. Take advantage of the increased daylight hours by
              sprucing up your living area! Now is also the ideal time to tidy
              up and get rid of things you no longer need. When looking at so
              many to-dos, there can be some resistance: too much to do, too
              little time. The best way to get things done is to not take on too
              much all at once, ideally by breaking up your spring cleaning into
              a bunch of small to-dos. That way, you get to experience successes
              more quickly. Our Spring Cleaning Challenge can help you with
              this. Take part from 16 April to 28 April and share in the
              motivation of doing your spring cleaning with other Goalify users.
              To-do list First have a look around where you live and think about
              which places need some tidying up. You likely have some things
              that you can throw out – sort out the things that you no longer
              need, no longer use or don’t wear very often anymore. Write down
              your to-dos, and specify which area of your flat or home that
              you’d like to work on as well as what things you want to get rid
              of. Keep in mind that one of the goals of spring cleaning is
              making room for something new in your life. Divide and conquer You
              might come to the conclusion that you’ve taken on too much, and
              your spring cleaning is looking more and more like an
              insurmountable task. If that happens, it makes good sense break up
              your big cleaning job into little mini-goals. You don’t have to do
              all of your cleaning and organizing in one day – instead choose a
              small thing that you know you can accomplish in a day, and do that
              again the next day. This way you never lose track of the bigger
              goal, and you also have a system for reaching it. Checklists Now
              make a checklist and consider what else you think ought to be
              included in your successful spring cleaning campaign. Do you need
              to pick up some cleaning supplies? Do you have enough cleaning
              rags? This is also the time to figure out where you can dispose of
              any bigger things that you’d like to get rid of. Create an
              additional checklist so that nothing stands between you and
              eliminate any obstacles that stand between you a a job well done.
              Start small and finish what you start Start with a smaller part of
              the cleaning, and then make sure that you actually do what you
              intended. You’ve already divided up the big job into many little,
              manageable tasks so you know that you can do what needs doing
              without overdoing it. Systematize it Take on your cleaning
              operation in a systematic way – that way you’ll waste less of your
              valuable time. Moreover it can be a good idea to take care of
              things from top to bottom, or from back to front if you like. If
              you’ve already vacuumed the floors and then you do the dusting,
              you’re going to swirl up dust and just make the floor dirty again.
              Take breaks You should also pause from whatever you’re working on
              from time to time, and make sure that you’re drinking enough.
              Cleaning can be hard work so you should make sure to stay
              hydrated. Freshen it up You can also use this opportunity to
              redecorate a little by changing up your living space. You could
              get a new vase and buy some spring flowers, or you could pick up a
              vibrant new rug for your living room or some colorful pillows for
              your sofa. Reward yourself After a successful cleaning day, or
              even after a few hours of cleaning, you can be happy with what
              you’ve accomplish and reward yourself a little: a piece of
              chocolate can be a good prize, or may some fresh spring
              strawberries – choose something that is a good motivator for
              you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
