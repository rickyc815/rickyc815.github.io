              Florian Sitzmann: Wheelchair Athlete, World Champion and Author
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              Florian Sitzmann is a German wheelchair athlete and author. He is
              well known for his success as a handcyclist at the Paralympics as
              well as in other international competitions. Tell me something
              about your background! How’s the best way to begin? Naturally I
              have to start with the accident, because that’s what derailed me
              from my life as a student and put me on another path. It was in
              1992. Actually I wanted to go into some kind of skilled trade
              after high school, something like finish carpentry, because I have
              a creative streak and I’m good with my hands. Then the accident
              happened: I was in Holland with a friend, and we were travelling
              around on a motorcycle – actually I was going to meet a girl there
              who I’d gotten to know beforehand. She wasn’t there though, and so
              we drank and had some fun instead. The next day we were on the way
              back home, but we totally overslept and the weather was bad. We
              climbed on the motorcycle and were on the road late into the
              night. Just before getting back we were really tired and we
              stopped to fill up the tank; we were exhausted and we just wanted
              to get home as soon as we could. We headed onto the autobahn – as
              it had been raining, visibility was bad – my friend drove too far
              to the left and didn’t notice that a big truck was coming from
              behind us. The motorcycle flipped over and I fell directly under
              the truck, which then ran over my legs twice. I was still awake
              for a long time on the highway and I couldn’t stand up. After 45
              minutes I lost consciousness, and the helicopter took me to the
              nearest clinic where my legs were amputated. Then there was a real
              hospital odyssey, which was very difficult and painful, and next
              rehabilitation – the darkest chapter of my life. I was very fit
              and energetic, but still I couldn’t learn anything there. Actually
              I wanted to learn to use a wheelchair, because it takes quite a
              long time learn how. I had to learn everything new again, and the
              world was kind of reset to zero. The most difficult thing for me
              though was our society: whenever I decided to go out, I was talked
              about and stared at. Now that’s not a problem for me, but at the
              start it was really hard for me. I made it through that time with
              a lot of humor and a good amount of making light of myself. By
              keeping at it, there’s a realistic chance that you will also reach
              your goal. What encouraged you to keep going? The lifesaver for me
              was that I always kept my perspective and had a goal in mind. You
              need something tangible that you can aim for. Maybe you want to
              feel better, or get your body into better shape – it doesn’t
              matter what – the main thing is that it makes you happy. I do a
              lot of things and I often think: too bad that my life isn’t long
              enough for me to do the many things that I’d like, and for the
              many ideas that I have.
