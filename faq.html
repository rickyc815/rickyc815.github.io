          <h1 class="mb-3">FAQ</h1>
          <p>1. Why should I register my Aimimi account?<br>Essential parts of the Aimimi coaching system are provided through our servers. That means that we can support you, even if you don’t have the app open. All your data is stored on your device and synced with our servers. Registering an account will allow you to restore your data and purchases or sync them to other devices. Rest assured that we won’t pass your e-mail address on to third parties and we also won’t send you annoying ads – you’ll find more info about this in our terms and conditions.<br><br>2.&nbsp;What is a goal in Aimimi?<br>The path becomes the goal when you use Aimimi. In a step-by-step way, Aimimi goals take you where you want to go, whether you want to learn something new, train or practice, reach a target or give something up. For each goal you establish periodic targets for yourself that you then complete and track. The approach involves moving closer to your goal in manageable steps that you then repeat. You’ll find additional info and ideas on this concept on our blog.<br><br>3.&nbsp;When should I use a target Amount Aim?<br>Target amount goals provide the most configuration possibilities. It’s best to use a target amount goal whenever you need a specific target, or if you want to record what you get done in partials steps. Here’s an example: You set a weekly target of 20 kilometers and you manage 5 kilometers four times per week – goal accomplished. Just make sure that you record every run. Goalify calculates your daily or weekly overall achievement automatically. No need to do that in your head. Maybe you want to drink two liters of water every day. Just record every glass that you drink and at the end of the day, you’ll have reached your goal. You can also set specific goals for every day of the week. This option is best suited for creating detailed training plans.<br><br>4.&nbsp;When do I use a Task Aim?<br>You use a task goal if you are not going after a specific value. The task is either complete or incomplete, like you know it from task managers. Here are a few examples: Picking up your apartment or flat once a week, going for a walk around the block every day, getting your coworkers together for a staff meeting once a week.<br><br>5.&nbsp;How do I pause a goal?<br>You can pause every goal in Goalify for either just the current day/week or for a certain period of time. To pause your goal for a certain period of time use the calendar view from your goal. Tap the red calendar-icon and choose the Edit Pauses option. Select the days, weeks or months that you want to pause or un-pause from the calendar. Weekly goals can only be paused for whole weeks, just like monthly goals can only be paused for the whole month. To pause your goal only for the current day/week/month use the skip option of your goal.<br><br>6.&nbsp;What happens if I delete a goal? If you delete a goal it will be completely removed from your dashboard and all your groups. Deleting a shared goal will also cancel a challenge that may be connected to it. You will no longer be able to access a deleted goal. Open the goal you would like to archive and choose the Delete goal option from the options menu . Deleting a goal cannot be undone.</p>
