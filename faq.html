              1. Why should I register my Aimimi account?<br />Essential parts
              of the Aimimi coaching system are provided through our servers.
              That means that we can support you, even if you don’t have the app
              open. All your data is stored on your device and synced with our
              servers. Registering an account will allow you to restore your
              data and purchases or sync them to other devices. Rest assured
              that we won’t pass your e-mail address on to third parties and we
              also won’t send you annoying ads – you’ll find more info about
              this in our terms and conditions.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;What is a
              goal in Aimimi?<br />The path becomes the goal when you use
              Aimimi. In a step-by-step way, Aimimi goals take you where you
              want to go, whether you want to learn something new, train or
              practice, reach a target or give something up. For each goal you
              establish periodic targets for yourself that you then complete and
              track. The approach involves moving closer to your goal in
              manageable steps that you then repeat. You’ll find additional info
              and ideas on this concept on our blog.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;When
              should I use a target Amount Aim?<br />Target amount goals provide
              the most configuration possibilities. It’s best to use a target
              amount goal whenever you need a specific target, or if you want to
              record what you get done in partials steps. Here’s an example: You
              set a weekly target of 20 kilometers and you manage 5 kilometers
              four times per week – goal accomplished. Just make sure that you
              record every run. Goalify calculates your daily or weekly overall
              achievement automatically. No need to do that in your head. Maybe
              you want to drink two liters of water every day. Just record every
              glass that you drink and at the end of the day, you’ll have
              reached your goal. You can also set specific goals for every day
              of the week. This option is best suited for creating detailed
              training plans.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;When do I use a Task Aim?<br />You
              use a task goal if you are not going after a specific value. The
              task is either complete or incomplete, like you know it from task
              managers. Here are a few examples: Picking up your apartment or
              flat once a week, going for a walk around the block every day,
              getting your coworkers together for a staff meeting once a
              week.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;How do I pause a goal?<br />You can pause
              every goal in Goalify for either just the current day/week or for
              a certain period of time. To pause your goal for a certain period
              of time use the calendar view from your goal. Tap the red
              calendar-icon and choose the Edit Pauses option. Select the days,
              weeks or months that you want to pause or un-pause from the
              calendar. Weekly goals can only be paused for whole weeks, just
              like monthly goals can only be paused for the whole month. To
              pause your goal only for the current day/week/month use the skip
              option of your goal.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;What happens if I delete a
              goal? If you delete a goal it will be completely removed from your
              dashboard and all your groups. Deleting a shared goal will also
              cancel a challenge that may be connected to it. You will no longer
              be able to access a deleted goal. Open the goal you would like to
              archive and choose the Delete goal option from the options menu .
              Deleting a goal cannot be undone.
